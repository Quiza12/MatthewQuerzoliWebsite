      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Whenever I'm not writing, at work or on the beers, I'm working on some cheeky software side projects.</p>
      <p>I had previously made a website that could tell you where it's currently five o'clock in the world so that you can justify your beers. <a href="https://github.com/Quiza12/ItsFiveOClockSomewhere" target="_blank">You can check it out on Github.</a></p>
      <p>I've also made a <a href="https://www.funnypasswordchecker.com/" target="_blank">password strength checker, with a funny side.</a></p>
      <p>The next one down the line will probably involve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j0UZEnaEH4" target="_blank">bogans</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Stay tuned for some more serious and not-so-serious projects in the future.</b></p>
