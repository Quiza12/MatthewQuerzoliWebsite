      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Whenever I'm not writing, at work or on the beers, I'm working on some cheeky software side projects.</p>
      <p>I recently made a website that can tell you <a href="https://www.itsfiveoclocksomewheregetmeabeer.com/" target="_blank">where it's currently five o'clock in the world</a> so that you can justify your beers.</p>
      <p>I'm in the process of building a password strength checker, with a funny side.</p>
      <p>The next one down the line will dogs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXILzUpVx7A" target="_blank">I like dogs.</a></p>
      <p><b>Stay tuned for some more serious and not-so-serious projects in the future.</b></p>
