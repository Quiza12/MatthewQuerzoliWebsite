      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Whenever I'm not writing, at work or on the beers, I'm working on some cheeky software side projects.</p>
      <p>This portfolio site, long ideated and finally finished, is the first of those. You can check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/Quiza12/matthewquerzoli-portfolio">here</a> if you want, but it's nothing new technology-wise.</p>
      <p>I'm also currently <a href="https://github.com/Quiza12/Chill-Pill">whipping up a Chrome extension</a> to clean up sites like Booking.com, removing all of the elements that try and pressure you into booking.</p>
      <p>The next one down the line will involve passwords. Then probably dogs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXILzUpVx7A">I like dogs.</a></p>
      <p><b>Stay tuned for some more serious and not-so-serious projects in the future.</b></p>
