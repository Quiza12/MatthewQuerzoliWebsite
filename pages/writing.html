      <p id="writing-quote"><i>"In the world according to her father, Jenny Garp knew, we must have energy."</i></p>
      <p>This is a quote from my favourite book, The World According to Garp by John Irving. This was the book that made me want to write fiction, among other pieces.</p>
      <p>I have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Well-Hung-Matthew-Querzoli-ebook/dp/B00WGOAW7O" target="_blank">self-published a book</a> (and like many self-published books, it sold next to nothing), been <a href="https://medium.com/the-quintessential-q/pilot-b4a493644ef9" target="_blank">longlisted for a short story prize</a>, and am in the midst of working on hopefully <a href="http://www.nownovel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/publishing.jpg" target="_blank">my first professionally published novel.</a></p>
      <p>Stayed tuned for that dream to come true, but for now, check out my <a href="https://medium.com/@mattq" target="_blank">blog</a>. I write short stories, vignettes, and flash fiction, as well as my fair share of satirical pieces, that are <a href="https://medium.com/@omb00900/apparently-you-missed-the-entire-reason-that-the-spacecraft-was-scuttled-8816105ec673" target="_blank">often mistaken for the real thing</a>.</p>
