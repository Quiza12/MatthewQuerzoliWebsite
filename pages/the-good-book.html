      <h2>The Good Book</h2>
      <h4>A practice in gratitude and the awareness of the infinite.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The residual heat from a freshly-ironed shirt in winter.</li>
        <li>Not a cloud in the sky.</li>
        <li>Sun on legs.</li>
        <li>A song that fits like a puzzle piece into your current emotional state.</li>
        <li>A book you just can't stop reading.</li>
        <li>A story that makes your cry.</li>
        <li>A dog looking for a pat.</li>
        <li>Abatement of anxiety, even if only for a short while.</li>
        <li>Rubbing sleep from your eyes.</li>
        <li>A cool swim on a hot day.</li>
        <li>Infectious laughter.</li>
        <li>A well-earned, perspiring schooner of beer.</li>
        <li>Fingers running through hair and nails scratching over scalp.</li>
        <li>A flower dancing in the breeze.</li>
        <li>Endorphins in the aftermath of a hard run.</li>
        <li>Riding a skateboard over fresh, smooth asphalt.</li>
        <li>Gulping down a glass of water when parched.</li>
        <li>A lawnmower finally stopping on a Saturday afternoon.</li>
        <li>Warm tea, with steam rising.</li>
        <li>The penny-drop of <i>understanding</i>.</li>
        <li>Seeing someone you love get excited and passionate about something.</li>
        <li>The roar of close to 100,000 at the MCG.</li>
        <li>A memory on a glossy photograph.</li>
        <li>Sliding into fresh, clean sheets.</li>
        <li>Electric blanket in winter.</li>
        <li>Waking up knowing you've got bugger all to do today, and that's just fine.</li>
        <li>Tiredness washed away by steaming coffee.</li>
        <li>A song finishing on the radio the moment you arrive home.</li>
        <li>The scent of buttered raisin toast in the late morning.</li>
      </ul>
