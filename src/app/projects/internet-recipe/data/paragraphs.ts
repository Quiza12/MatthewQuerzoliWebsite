  'Four score and seven years ago, when I was but a young man, and the sunlight danced above me and drew my eyes to it like a wingless moth, I remember my mother in the kitchen, cooking INTERNET RECIPE. The smells were all-encompasing; the sounds a cacophany, such that my other senses were held fast with the overload of these two senses. And then came the taste - of a single piece of juicy red capsicum. Then, a stalk of green onion - the greenest part of the stem, with which one might use for garnish. I utterly demolished these offerings from my mother - officially off breast milk and now well-practised and shoving whatever what near into my gob. Compared to my younger siblings, my mum would tell me later, I was the only one who liked the spring onion. I didn\'t cast it aside, off the high chair and onto the floor below (despite the large catchment area of the table, stained with splotches of pasta sauce from previous missed delivery attempts). I indugled and I have loved all thing smelly (onion, garlic etc) ever since.',
  'Speaking of capsicums, I\'m aware that these are called "peppers" by people in other countries, but I continue to be be referring to them by their proper name. Suffer in ya jocks, pepper-countries.',
  'To be fair to those countries, it is more efficient to say "pepper" - you save a syllable each time. Imagine what you could do with all that time saved with all those syllables. I do, however, witness Australians, and the way we shorten anything at all (service station = servo, chocolate = choccie, afternoon = arvo, capsicum != capo), and by that yardstick, we should be the most efficient people in the world, but in no way, shape or form is that the reality.',
  'Pepper reminds me distinctly of peppercorns, and forever will. From a cursory search, it appears that peppercorns are in fact completely distinct from the pepper/capsicum plant, which doesn\'t surprise me, although it would also not surprise me that I was just given some AI slop ',
  'Anyway, that\'s a long way to say there\'s capsicum in this dish. And that Australians are efficient/inefficient. And that we must be diligent and remove ourselves from the AI slop that\'s out there and will surely grow to the point of blanketing the Internet that we know, like snow on Christmas over a middle-class American suburb where all the little kiddies unpack toys produced by elves (factory workers) in the North Pole (China, India, Bangladesh etc).',
  'Where was I? Oh, yeah.',
  'Ok - so my mum was cooking INTERNET RECIPE, the smells bloomed and my world was filled with the anticipation of a meal that tantalised the senses, and would go on to hold my fascination throughout my life, and would one day lead me to create this website and publish this recipe. There is no bloody way that this recipe will sit in my recipe box, or my mum\'s recipe box, or her mum\'s recipe box, etc etc, and continue to get progressively more yellow until I can no longer read the handwriting, and even though I remember it off by heart, my beating beating heart, I decided to share it with the braoder world for the joy of your own kitchen and that sweet, sweet ad revenue (enough to supplement my corporate job wage until I can make enough here and end up like the Queen, Nagi \'Recipe Tin Eats\' Maehashi.',
  'This version of INTERNET RECIPE is explicitly designed for an achievable nightly meal. Typically, the best and most classic version of INTERNET RECIPE would be completed from scratch in about 72-hours, especially if you were to ferment the dough for long enough and hunt your own wild hog.',

  'A quick aside - how good\'s the movie Ratatouille? When Remy and Emile reunite and Remy makes Emile slow down and taste the cheese, then the grape, and then both together to get a dynamite flavour combination? I reckon that\'s what inspired me to feed my local rats the good cheese.',
  'The war changed not only the foundation of the world, but the base of the entire INTERNET RECIPE. Suddenly, my great-grandmother had to change from using beef stock to vegetable stock, which was a matter of necessity more than anything else. She also did away with using a dismantled gun barrel to stir INTERNET RECIPE while it lay simmering away; she could go back to using her trusty wooden spoon. My grandmother told my mother one point that she suspected that her mother believed that her wooden spoon added extra flavour into INTERNET RECIPE, on account of how much she used to clobber her and her siblings with the same spoon.',
  'Yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah (this is an Australian filler sentence - often used directly in conversation - but luckily for your it will be used here to ground my INTERNET RECIPE account in cultural context).',

  'Tomatoes are seminal part of INTERNET RECIPE. Even further to this, tomatoes are a seminal part of ME. You could probably say that for anyone that grew up where tomatoes feature heavily in diets, not in least Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Africa, China and India (so a not insignificant portion of the entire world). This got me thinking too - if tomatoes are roughly 95% water, and humans are on average about 60% water, that means that it\'s likely that I am, on any given, tomato-heavy day, 30% tomato (reliable maths right here - I did pass Advanced Maths in the HSC somehow (actually I do know how - it was a lot of hard work and repetition of solving problems, often with the help of a tutor (I was very lucky to be able to have a tutor; one day I may be torn down for not "lifting myself up by my bootstraps" but it was what I needed at the time and I did not waste it, for my day job is now as a nuclear physicist (by nuclear physicist I mean middle management, off the tools)))).',

  'I worry sometimes that hawking my family recipes online to get more than a few AdSense dollars will be entirely undone with the advent of AI. Maybe I should have seen this coming - maybe my great-grandmother would have seen this coming. Perhaps if she had seen this coming she would have instead written down some sort of recipe for AI that would have pushed my family in the direction of breaking into the market first and ratcheting up a billion-dollar valuation almost overnight. Maybe set me and subsequent generations up for many lifetimes, rather than providing me with something that would feed the insatiable beast of AI as it mopped up everything in its path on the Internet, with no regard for the original source material or care for where the ideas came from in the first place. Perhaps with that money we could have afforded to revamp an abandoned oil rig somewhere it the south Pacific to hide out when the machines inevtiably took over, thanks to the hubris of my great-grandmother, all those years ago.',
  'All the recipe-writing is making me hungry. BRB.',
  'INTERNET RECIPE is is no way, shape or form better when heated up as leftovers (what is?), but if for some stupid reason you don\'t demolish the entire thing on first serving (including the plate you served it on), I suppose you can heat this up low and slow in a saucepan, stirring occasionally, until hot and ready. But you should still take a good, long look at yourself in the mirror before consuming, you joker.',
  'Sometimes I scroll one of the food delivery apps when I\'m hungover for hours, before finally landing on the same thing I always order - a large Big Mac meal with a Diet Coke (healthy), plus an extra cheeseburger with no pickles (I don\'t mind pickles on my Big Mac funnily enough). It\'s like I\'m edging myself with fast food. This is despite having an incredbily well-stocked kitchen. The shame. However even after the disgust I feel, immediately after consuming the cardboard-and-paper-wrapped contents that some poor bloke on an e-bike with a student visa has somehow delivered within twenty-five minutes (take that hunter-gatherers!), sometimes a greasy takeaway is the only thing that hits the spot, and by spot I mean my beleagured, still-inebriated braincells, my queasy, rum-and-coke-soaked gut and my coke-encrusted nostrils.',
  'It should be noted, on step 5, please remember to preheat the oven. Don\'t do what my girlfriend does and get impatient at the preheating and just jam it inside before it\'s finished preheating. It will also not work in an airfryer - that lazy contraption that, just like the advent of TikTok and short-form video content slop, will be the downfall of the human attention span and the dedication required to make beautiful, slower things INTERNET RECIPE for generations hence.',
  'One of the biggest disappointments in life is watching otherwise intelligent or sophisticated people fail to cook anything but two-minute noodles for themselves. Learn the basics mate, it\'s not hard, and what\'s more, it\'s infinitely rewarding.',
  'Seasoning! Don\'t forget it. Test often for it. Also, don\'t overrely on it. It\'s not a magic tool. It won\'t save INTERNET RECIPE if you mess it up at some critical point (take all of this with a grain of salt - haha, get it?).',
  'I miss the old-format food/cooking YouTubers, who didn\'t shout information at you like questions at some black-site CIA interrogation, or decide to rate the different types of Poptarts and work out which one is "best" (what the hell is a Poptart?). I don\'t mind a sponsor plug, but if it\'s the difference between getting a few hundred thousand views or not, let\'s tone it down, take it back to useful, clear information to assist people with their cooking game. Amongst several opinions expressed on this INTERNET RECIPE blog post, this may be my most "old man yells at clouds" take.',
  'At one point, I was considering doing an all-meat, carnivore diet, but because it meant I would no longer be able to have INTERNET RECIPE, I decided against it. That, and I enjoyed the amount of fiber I currently consumed, especially considering how much it held with my digestion.',
  'Onion and garlic sizzling away in the pan together is not only a sensory religious experience, but the fundamental beginning of INTERNET RECIPE. Genuinely, the Pope should canonize the entire experience.',
