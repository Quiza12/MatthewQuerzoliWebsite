  'A quick aside - how good\'s the movie Ratatouille? When Remy and Emile reunite and Remy makes Emile slow down and taste the cheese, then the grape, and then both together to get a dynamite flavour combination? I reckon that\'s what inspired me to feed my local rats the good cheese.',
  'The war changed not only the foundation of the world, but the base of the entire INTERNET RECIPE. Suddenly, my great-grandmother had to change from using beef stock to veegtable stock, which was a matter of necessity more than anything else. She also did away with using a dismantled gun barrel to stir INTERNET RECIPE while it lay simmering away; she could go back to using her trusty wooden spoon. My grandmother told my mother one point that she suspected that her mother believed that her wooden spoon added extra flavour into INTERNET RECIPE, on account of how much she used to clobber her and her siblings with the same spoon.',
  'Yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah (this is an Australian filler sentence - often used directly in conversation - but luckily for your it will be used here to ground my INTERNET RECIPE account in cultural context).',

  'Tomatoes are seminal part of INTERNET RECIPE. Even further to this, tomatoes are a seminal part of ME. You could probably say that for anyone that grew up where tomatoes feature heavily in diets, not in least Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Africa, China and India (so a not insignificant portion of the entire world). This got me thinking too - if tomatoes are roughly 95% water, and humans are on average about 60% water, that means that it\'s likely that I am, on any given, tomato-heavy day, 30% tomato.',

  'I worry sometimes that hawking my family recipes online to get more than a few AdSense dollars will be entirely undone with the advent of AI. Maybe I should have seen this coming - maybe my great-grandmother would have seen this coming. Perhaps if she had seen this coming she would have instead written down some sort of recipe for AI that would have pushed my family in the direction of breaking into the market first and ratcheting up a billion-dollar valuation almost overnight. Maybe set me and subsequent generations up for many lifetimes, rather than providing me with something that would feed the insatiable beast of AI as it mopped up everything in its path on the Internet, with no regard for the original source material or care for where the ideas came from in the first place. Perhaps with that money we could have afforded to revamp an abandoned oil rig somewhere it the south Pacific to hide out when the machines inevtiably took over, thanks to the hubris of my great-grandmother, all those years ago.',
