  'A quick aside - how good\'s the movie Ratatouille? When Remy and Emile reunite and Remy makes Emile slow down and taste the cheese, then the grape, and then both together to get a dynamite flavour combination? I reckon that\'s what inspired me to feed my local rats the good cheese.',
  'The war changed not only the foundation of the world, but the base of the entire INTERNET RECIPE. Suddenly, my great-grandmother had to change from using beef stock to veegtable stock, which was a matter of necessity more than anything else. She also did away with using a dismantled gun barrel to stir INTERNET RECIPE while it lay simmering away; she could go back to using her trusty wooden spoon. My grandmother told my mother one point that she suspected that her mother believed that her wooden spoon added extra flavour into INTERNET RECIPE, on account of how much she used to clobber her and her siblings with the same spoon.',
  'Yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah yeah nah (this is an Australian filler sentence - often used directly in conversation - but luckily for your it will be used here to ground my INTERNET RECIPE account in cultural context).',

  'Tomatoes are seminal part of INTERNET RECIPE. Even further to this, tomatoes are a seminal part of ME. You could probably say that for anyone that grew up where tomatoes feature heavily in diets, not in least Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Africa, China and India (so a not insignificant portion of the entire world). This got me thinking too - if tomatoes are roughly 95% water, and humans are on average about 60% water, that means that it\'s likely that I am, on any given, tomato-heavy day, 30% tomato (reliable maths right here - I did pass Advanced Maths in the HSC somehow (actually I do know how - it was a lot of hard work and repetition of solving problems, often with the help of a tutor (I was very lucky to be able to have a tutor; one day I may be torn down for not "lifting myself up by my bootstraps" but it was what I needed at the time and I did not waste it, for my day job is now as a nuclear physicist (by nuclear physicist I mean middle management, off the tools)))).',

  'I worry sometimes that hawking my family recipes online to get more than a few AdSense dollars will be entirely undone with the advent of AI. Maybe I should have seen this coming - maybe my great-grandmother would have seen this coming. Perhaps if she had seen this coming she would have instead written down some sort of recipe for AI that would have pushed my family in the direction of breaking into the market first and ratcheting up a billion-dollar valuation almost overnight. Maybe set me and subsequent generations up for many lifetimes, rather than providing me with something that would feed the insatiable beast of AI as it mopped up everything in its path on the Internet, with no regard for the original source material or care for where the ideas came from in the first place. Perhaps with that money we could have afforded to revamp an abandoned oil rig somewhere it the south Pacific to hide out when the machines inevtiably took over, thanks to the hubris of my great-grandmother, all those years ago.',
  'All the recipe-writing is making me hungry. BRB.',
  'INTERNET RECIPE is is no way, shape or form better when heated up as leftovers (what is?), but if for some stupid reason you don\'t demolish the entire thing on first serving (including the plate you served it on), I suppose you can heat this up low and slow in a saucepan, stirring occasionally, until hot and ready. But you should still take a good, long look at yourself in the mirror before consuming, you joker.',
  'Sometimes I scroll one of the food delivery apps when I\'m hungover for hours, before finally landing on the same thing I always order - a large Big Mac meal with a Diet Coke (healthy), plus an extra cheeseburger with no pickles (I don\'t mind pickles on my Big Mac funnily enough). It\'s like I\'m edging myself with fast food. This is despite having an incredbily well-stocked kitchen. The shame. However even after the disgust I feel, immediately after consuming the cardboard-and-paper-wrapped contents that some poor bloke on an e-bike with a student visa has somehow delivered within twenty-five minutes (take that hunter-gatherers!), sometimes a greasy takeaway is the only thing that hits the spot, and by spot I mean my beleagured, still-inebriated braincells, my queasy, rum-and-coke-soaked gut and my coke-encrusted nostrils.',
  'It should be noted, on step 5, please remember to preheat the oven. Don\'t do what my girlfriend does and get impatient at the preheating and just jam it inside before it\'s finished preheating. It will also not work in an airfryer - that lazy contraption that, just like the advent of TikTok and short-form video content slop, will be the downfall of the human attention span and the dedication required to make beautiful, slower things INTERNET RECIPE for generations hence.'
