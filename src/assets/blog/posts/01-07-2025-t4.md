## T4

The salt of Cronulla. \
The clean concrete of Woolooware. \
The lads of Caringbah. \
The commerce captial of Miranda. \
The Faraday cage of Gymea. \
The birds of Kirrawee. \
The screeching-rail interchange of Sutherland. \
The leafy overpass of Jannali. \
The sleepy residents of Como. \
The old and new of Oatley. \
The rushers at Mortdale. \
The bleary-eyed of Penshurst. \
The cram at Hurstville. \
The clash of humanity and nature of Wolli Creek. \
The brown tiles of Redfern. \
The heart of Central. \
The thoroughfare of Town Hall. \
The stateliness of Martin Place. \
The grimy seduction of Kings Cross. \
The almost-there of Edgecliff. \
The rumbling buses of Bondi Junction.
